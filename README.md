# Ariadne
üå± is a small software package for analyzing images of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ roots.

üì∑ It features a GUI for semi-automated image segmentation

‚è∞ with support for time-series GIFs

<img src="assets/early-final.gif" width="250" height="250">

‚ò†Ô∏è that creates dynamic 2D skeleton graphs of the root system architecture (RSA).

üîç It's designed specifically to handle complex, messy, and highly-branched root systems well ‚Äî the same situations in which current methods fail.

üìä It also includes some (very cool) algorithms for analyzing those skeletons, which were mostly developed by other (very cool) people<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. The focus is on measuring cost-performance trade-offs and Pareto optimality in RSA networks.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is very much a work-in-progress! These are custom scripts written for an ongoing research project ‚Äî so all code is provided as-is.

üî® That said, if you're interested in tinkering with the code, enjoy! PRs are always welcome. And please reach out with any comments, ideas, suggestions, or feedback.

## Installation

Ariadne is installed as a Python package called `ariadne-roots`. We recommend using a package manager and creating an isolated environment for `ariadne-roots` and its dependencies. Our recommended package manager is Mamba. Follow the instructions to install [Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

You can find the latest version of `ariadne-roots` on the [Releases](https://github.com/Salk-Harnessing-Plants-Initiative/Ariadne/releases) page.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Create an isolated environment:**
    ```sh
    mamba create --name ariadne python=3.11
    ```

2. **Activate your environment:**
    ```sh
    mamba activate ariadne
    ```

3. **Install `ariadne-roots` using pip:**
    ```sh
    pip install ariadne-roots
    ```

## Usage

1. **Activate your environment:**
    ```sh
    mamba activate ariadne
    ```

2. **Open the GUI:**
    ```sh
    ariadne-trace
    ```


### Trace with Ariadne

1. **Click on ‚ÄúTrace‚Äù** to trace roots.
2. The following window should open:

    <img src="assets/Trace_Menu.png" width="450" height="450">

3. **Click on ‚ÄúImport image file‚Äù** and select the image to trace the roots.
4. **Select the zoom factor for your image** 
    - A window should popup asking for the zoom factor
    - Use the "Zoom in" and Zoom out" button to adjust the zoom needed to trace the root system with high precision
    - Click on "OK"
    - After this, any new image imported will be opened with the identical zoom factor
    - Remark: after closing Ariadne, the zoom factor will be canceled. Therefore, take note of the zoom factor used and reapply the same everytime when restarting Ariadne.
5. **Trace the first root:**
    - Start tracing the entire primary root first (it should appear green).
    - To save time, place a dot on each region where a lateral root is emitted.
6. **Save the traced root:**
    - When the first root is fully traced, click on the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button on the left-hand menu of Ariadne or press ‚Äúg‚Äù on your keyboard.
    - A new window will pop up asking for the plant ID. Tap any letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù or number "1".
        - Each time you click on ‚ÄúSave‚Äù, a .json file will be saved in the folder at the location of Location_1 (see above).
7. **Trace additional roots:**
    - When you are done tracing the first root, click on the ‚ÄúChange root‚Äù button on the left-hand menu of Ariadne.
    - Select a new plant ID, like ‚ÄúB‚Äù, to trace the second root.
    - Continue tracing each root on your image following these steps.
8. **Finish tracing:**
    - When you have traced all roots on your image, click on ‚ÄúChange root‚Äù and repeat from ‚ÄúStep 3‚Äù above for any new images.

### Analyze with Ariadne

1. **Organize your files:**
    - Gather all the .json files stored at the location where Ariadne has been installed into a new folder named ‚ÄúOUTPUT_JSON‚Äù (referred to as ‚Äúlocation_1‚Äù later on).
    - Create a folder named ‚ÄúRESULTS‚Äù (referred to as ‚Äúlocation_2‚Äù).
    - Create a new folder named ‚ÄúOutput‚Äù.
2. **Prepare for analysis:**
    - Close Ariadne but keep the terminal open.
    - Follow the instructions in step 2 above to set up the terminal.
3. **Run the analysis:**
    - Click on ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù in Ariadne.

    <img src="assets/Welcome.png" width="400" height="250">

    - Select the .json files to analyze from ‚Äúlocation_1‚Äù.
    - Then select ‚Äúlocation_2‚Äù for the output.
    - The software will analyze all the selected .json files.

### Results

- In the ‚Äúlocation_3‚Äù folder, you will find:
    - A graph for each root showing the Pareto optimality.
    - A .csv file storing all the RSA traits for each root.

The RSA traits included in the CSV are

## Releasing `ariadne-roots`

The GitHub Action workflow `.github/workflows/python-publish.yml` results in the package, `ariadne-roots`, being released at [PyPI](https//pypi.org/project/ariadne-roots/).

To release a new package, follow these instructions:

### Follow contributing instructions above

1. **Make a new branch to record your changes**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <your_name>/bump_version_to_<version>
    ```

### Modify version

The `pyproject.toml` file contains the information for the pip package. Incrementally increase the "version" with each release.

#### Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning (SemVer) is a versioning system that uses the format:
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR:** Increase when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR:** Increase when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH:** Increase when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

For example:

- If the current version is `1.2.3`:
  - A breaking change would result in `2.0.0`.
  - Adding a new feature would result in `1.3.0`.
  - Fixing a bug would result in `1.2.4`.

Learn more about the rules of semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org).

### Commit changes

After making the required modifications:
```sh
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Bump version to <version>"
git push origin <your_name>/bump_version_to_<version>
```

### Open a pull request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. You should see a banner prompting you to compare & create a pull request for your branch. Click it.
3. Fill in the pull request title and description. For example:
    - **Title:** Bump version to `<version>`
    - **Description:** "This PR updates the version to `<version>` for release."
4. Click **Create pull request**.

### Request a review

After creating the pull request, in the right-hand sidebar, click on **Reviewers** and select the appropriate reviewer(s). Notify the reviewer(s) via GitHub.

### Merge your changes to `main` after review

Once the reviewer approves your pull request, merge it into the `main` branch.

### Release to trigger the workflow

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/Salk-Harnessing-Plants-Initiative).
2. Draft a new release:
    - Create a new tag with the version number you used in the repository.
    - Have GitHub draft the release notes to include all the changes since the last release.
    - Modify the release name to include `ariadne-roots`, so that it says `ariadne-roots v<version>` like the rest.
3. Please ask for your release to be reviewed before releasing.

### Verify the release

Check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ariadne-roots/#history) and the GitHub Actions of our repository to make sure the pip package was created and published successfully.
    - You should see the latest release with the correct version number at pypi.org.
    - The Github Actions should have green checkmarks and not red X's associated with your release.
