# Ariadne
üå± is a small software package for analyzing images of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ roots.

üì∑ It features a GUI for semi-automated image segmentation

‚ò†Ô∏è that creates dynamic 2D skeleton graphs of the root system architecture (RSA).

üîç It's designed specifically to handle complex, messy, and highly-branched root systems well ‚Äî the same situations in which current methods fail.

üìä It also includes some (very cool) algorithms for analyzing those skeletons, which were mostly developed by other (very cool) people<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. The focus is on measuring cost-performance trade-offs and Pareto optimality in RSA networks.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is very much a work-in-progress! These are custom scripts written for a small, ongoing research project ‚Äî so all code is provided as-is.

üî® That said, if you're interested in tinkering with the code, enjoy! PRs are always welcome. And please reach out with any comments, ideas, suggestions, or feedback.

## Installation
#### Using `conda`
After cloning the repo, open a command line and navigate to it. Now type

```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

A new Python virtual environment, with all the necessary dependencies installed, is now ready to use. Activate it with

```
conda activate ariadne
```

## Use
To get started, type

```
python main.py
```

#### Keybinds
* `Left-click`: place/select node. To pan, hold `Alt` or `Ctrl` and drag
* `t`: toggle skeleton visibility (default: on)
* `e`: next frame (GIFs only)
* `q`: previous frame (GIFs only)
* `r`: toggle proximity override. By default, clicking on or near an existing node will select it. When this override is on, a new node will be placed instead. Useful for finer control in crowded areas (default: off)
* `i`: toggle insertion mode. By default, new nodes extend a branch (i.e., have a degree of 1). Alternatively, use insertion mode to intercalate a new node between 2 existing ones. Useful for handling emering lateral roots in regions you have already segmented (default: off)
* `g`: Save output file
* `d`: Delete currently selected node(s)
* `Ctrl-Z`: Undo last action
